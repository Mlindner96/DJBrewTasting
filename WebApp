    "Description": "Dylan: This beer was definitely worth the 45 minute wait at Great South Bay Brewery to pick up its limited release. The color is a dark hazy red with a pinkish foam head. Not super sour, but it really reminded me of sour patch kids! I can't wait to get more of this brew. I would rate this beer 8.7/10 \n Jakey: Just like the candy this brew is sour at first with cherry on the backend. The smell of this beer is very fruity with a really dark heavy body. I've been loving the sours that Great South Bay Brewery has been putting out recently. I would rate this beer 8.7/10 as well. \n Can Design: 10/10, the can really looks like a bag of sour patch kids and that's very awesome!",
